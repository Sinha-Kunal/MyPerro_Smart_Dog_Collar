DHT11 and MPU6050 Sensor Data Display with OLED
This code demonstrates how to read data from a DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor and an MPU6050 accelerometer, and display the data on an OLED screen. It also counts steps based on the acceleration data.

Hardware Requirements
Arduino board
DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor
MPU6050 accelerometer
OLED display (SSH1106_128x64)
Wiring
Connect the VCC, GND, SDA, and SCL pins of the DHT11 sensor to 5V, GND, A4, and A5 on the Arduino board, respectively.
Connect the VCC, GND, SDA, and SCL pins of the MPU6050 accelerometer to 5V, GND, A4, and A5 on the Arduino board, respectively.
Connect the VCC, GND, SDA, and SCL pins of the OLED display to 5V, GND, SDA, and SCL on the Arduino board, respectively.
